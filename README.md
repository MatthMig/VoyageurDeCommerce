# Little Algorithm for Traveling Salesman Problem

This project implements a variant of the Little algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem. The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic optimization problem in which the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits a given set of cities and returns to the starting city.
The Little algorithm is a heuristic algorithm used to approximate solutions to the TSP. This implementation provides a variant of the algorithm and offers a practical way to find near-optimal solutions for real-world TSP instances.

# Documentation

Detailed documentation for the project can be found in the Rapport___Voyageur_de_Commerce___Little.pdf file, written in French. This document provides an in-depth explanation of the algorithm, its implementation, and usage instructions.
